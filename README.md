# Triviachat

In this lab, we combined the two labs we worked on last week: spotify navigation and a trivia chatbot. Instead of a list of songs that can be pressed to view song details, we ended up with a list of conversations/chatbots that can be pressed to open up that conversation!

### Setup Repository
1. Clone the repo into your desired folder
2. Open the project code in VSCode (use `code .` if you can)
3. Open terminal in the VSCode window then run `yarn` to install packages
4. Launch the project with `yarn expo start`
